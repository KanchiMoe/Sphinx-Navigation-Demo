# Sphinx Navigation Demo
A small project to test and experiment with [Sphinx's](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) handling of where [index blocks](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-toctree) are located, and how that impacts the navigation sidebar using [Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).

## Demo
